Feature: The backend for the graphing functionality which gets the counts of each attribute for a chosen category
  Scenario Outline: Get the counts of each attribute for a category
    Given the category is <category>
    And the list of attributes is:
      | <attribute1>     |
      | <attribute2>     |
      | <attribute3>     |
      | <attribute4>     |
    And the database contains the table "countsTest"
    When I get the counts of each attribute
    Then the respective counts should be:
      | <count1> |
      | <count2> |
      | <count3> |
      | <count4> |

    Examples:
      | category          | attribute1         | attribute2           | attribute3  | attribute4     | count1  | count2 | count3 | count4 |
